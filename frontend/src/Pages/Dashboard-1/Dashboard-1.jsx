              The Admin is the backbone of NexOptima, responsible for managing
              the entire system. They create and assign projects to managers,
              ensuring smooth workflow distribution. Admins also handle user
              management, adding employees and managers, assigning login
              credentials, and maintaining security. With full control over
              project allocation, they set the foundation for efficient task
              execution.

              The Manager acts as the bridge between Admin and Employees, taking
              ownership of projects assigned by the Admin. They break down
              projects into structured tasks, assigning them to employees based
              on expertise and workload. Managers oversee task progress,
              ensuring timely completion, and provide necessary support to
              employees. With access to performance tracking, they ensure
              efficiency across the team.

              The Employee is responsible for executing assigned tasks with

              ensure that tasks are completed within deadlines while maintaining
